# The Dungeon

In this tutorial we are going to create a game called the The Dungeon using Phaser.  The game will be using javascript classes to organise the code, Phase States to help structure the game and a Phaser Tile Map to edit the data.  This is an advanced project, but its been broken down into small steps that will walk you through each set of changes we make.

## Pre Requisites

As mentioned, this is an advances javascript and phaser tutorial.  Best if you have some experience before starting so I suggest you work through the Donkey game. 

https://github.com/dojojon/phaser/tree/master/donkey

You can use what ever IDE you prefer for web development, but I recommed VSCode.  

You will need to run a local web server.  We use Python 3 to do this, but the choice is yours.

```python -m http.server```

This tutorial will run on most modern browsers, Chrome, Firefox, Safar, Edge.  It has not been tested on Internet Explorer so you may have problems as this does not fully support some everything we are using.

## Source code

You can find this tutorial on github.

You will need to clone this repository or download this code from the root of the github project.

## Steps

This project has been broken down into chunks will help up build up the game as we go along.  Each section has a staring folder, so if you want to jump in at ```Creating a Player``` skipping earlier steps you can.

If you want to look at the completed game, check out the source code in full subfolder.
