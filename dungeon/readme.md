# The Dungeon

In this tutorial we are going to create a game called the The Dungeon using Phaser.  The game will be using javascript classes to organise the code, Phase States to help structure the game and a Phaser Tile Map to edit the data.  This is an advanced project, but its been broken down into small steps that will walk you through each set of changes we make.
