# Making games for the web with Phaser 

<h1>Under Construction</h1>
I'm not finished, so bookmark this page of favorite it in github.  I'll remove this section once done.  

This repository is content for the Arklow Coder Dojo.

## What is Phaser

Phaser is a javascript framework for making HTML5 Desktop and Mobile games.

You can find more out about phaser on its website http://www.phaser.io.

These tutorials have been created assuming you have no knowledge of html and javascript, but having a little knowledge of these will be useful.  The Basic Site tutorial gives a very high level run through of html, css and javascript and running them on your PC using a Python web server.   

## I've seen a wheel and I'm not going to reinvent it.

Some of the content is based on other public tutorials available to all on the web. The content has just been structured to make it easier to present in a coder dojo session.  A link to the original content can be found at the top of the sessions readme file.  

## Getting set up

### Editor

You will need to use a text editor to edit the source files in these tutorials.  You can even do this with something as simple as notepad on windows, but using a more advanced editor that provides support for HTML and Javascript files will be easier.  There are lots to choose from, but my recommendation is VS Code.  It runs on Windows, Macs and Linux operating systems and has great support for lots of programming languages.  Also its free.

You can download and install a copy from here https://code.visualstudio.com/

### A web server? But I want to make games!

Its recommended to run phaser using a web server. You find out the reason why here http://phaser.io/tutorials/getting-started/index  
This sounds complicated, but don't worry there are lots of options listed on the phaser site.

As our dojo has already used Python so we are going to use this approach.
